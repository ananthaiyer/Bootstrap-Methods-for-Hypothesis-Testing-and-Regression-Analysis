# Bootstrap-Methods-for-Hypothesis-Testing-and-Regression-Analysis
1. Perform bootstrap-based hypothesis testing on two samples, comparing means using t-tests, permutation tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and evaluate results at different significance levels.
2. Use residual and pairs bootstrap methods for a linear regression model to estimate confidence intervals for coefficients and assess the inclusion of predictors.
3. Compare parametric and non-parametric approaches to hypothesis testing and regression, explaining the effects of sampling strategies on results.
4. Summarize the advantages and disadvantages of bootstrapping methods for constructing confidence intervals and conducting statistical tests.
